<h1>Chapter 7 Notes</h1>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p> In this chapter we learned how to undo changes made to a file and then we learned how to unstage files so they wont be tracked anymore and then we learned how to work with amending commits and then we learned how to get rid of old versions of a file with git and then we learned how to revert commit back to the last one we just did, then we learned how to rest a commit to the one we committed before, and then we how to make a soft reset and rewind the HEAD point to the last know point so the log will no longer show us the last commit. Then we learned how to do a soft reset with git and then we learned how to preform a hard rest so if we needed to get things back to a original state they were in to begin with. Then we also learned how to remove untracked files so that way if we didn't mean to put them to be tracked or someone had put a file into the wrong depository.</p>

<h1>Chapter 12 Notes</h1>
<h2> Chapter 12 Notes</h2>
<p> In this chapter we learned how to save changes in the Stash and you do it like this git stash save and then the name of the file. Then we learned how to view staged changes and you do that like this git stash list and it will tell us what item is in the stash. Then we learned how to revert stashed changes and you do that like this git stash then the name to tell it which one we want to pull out. Then we learned how to delete stashed changes and you do it like this git stash drop then the stash name.</p>

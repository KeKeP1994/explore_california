<h1>Chapter 10 Notes</h1>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p> We learned about the branching overview and the branches is a way to add things to a master branch and if it doesn't work out just get rid of that branch and you don't have to worry about messing up the main branch and if it works all you have to do is merge the branches together. We also learned how to view and create branches and all you have to do is to look at it you have to type git branch it will show you all the branches and there will be a * by the one you are on. To create a new branch all you need to do is type git branch and the name of the new branch and make sure there are no spaces in the name replaces the spaces either with a - or a _.  We also learned how to switch between the different branches ad you do that by doing it like this git checkout followed by the name of the branch and then it will be changed to that branch you specified. We also learned how to switch between branches with uncommitted changes and you do that by  committing the changes and and then switching the files and after you have switched you can create a new file and then you can  switch to a new branch and it will just say that change is uncommitted. Then we learned  how to compare branches and you do it like this git diff one name .. the other name, then when typing them out you will type out the one that is further back in time would normally come first in the sequence. Then we learned how to rename branches and you can do it like this git branch -m name of branch  new brach name. Git considers a -m as a rename so it is the same thing. Then we learned how to delete branches and you can do it like this git branch -d name of branch you want to delete and then it will deleted. git has a few things in place to make sure you don't delete  branch that is needed you can do git checkout and then the branch name then if you try and delete the branch you are on it will not let you an make sure you are in another branch and not the main file so when you delete that branch it doesn't leave you stranded with nothing. If we make a commit to the new branch then we get out of it and try to delete it it will tells us there is files not merged and to use -D to tell it, it is really ok to trash this branch. Then we learned how to configure the command prompt to show the branch and you do it like this __git_ps1 then it will put the name of the branch there and if you are not in a git fie then it will not show anything. the prompt is stored in ps1 or prompt string 1 and we can see the echo of the prompt b typing echo $ps1 and then it will bring up the information.</p>

<h1>Chapter 9 Notes</h1>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p> In this chapter we learned how to reference a commit and navigate a repository commit tree, and a thing you can use is the treeish and that is the reference to a commit. and then we learned how to explore a tree listing and to pass in the treeish you write it like this tree-ish and then type the name of the document that you want to look at. or you can do it like this ls-tree name of folder or file and it will give us the tree-ish. Then we learned how to get more information out of our git log and some more things you can do from the log instead of just getting the information about a certain log, the most common one is git --oneline and that will gives us a one line list  of what is in the file instead of the long list. You can also tell it the number of files you want it to show you like this git --oneline -3 and only three files will show up in the list. You can also filter the log by the time command like this git --since (date) and it will give us all the things in that log in that time frame  you can also use the key word --until and --after the same way. We also learned how to view specific commits and you could do this by getting the git log and then just going and finding the one you desire. If you want to examine a commit and see what was changed do it by  typing out the regular get log then you type out git show then the shaw of that commit. Then we learned how to compare two different comments like this git git diff and it will return the changes made between the working directory and staging directory.  If you want to see the different between the staging directory and the head or main repository then you type git diff --staged or --cached to get back a list of those changes. The diff command is ver versatile about what you type after it.</p>

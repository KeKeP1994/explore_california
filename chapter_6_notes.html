<h1>Chapter 6 Notes</h1>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p> In this chapter we have learned how initialize git files and then we learned how to change files and put them back on git so they can track. On the files for chapter six I will list them for the first 7 html files all we did was go in and change the contact number at the bottom of the page and them track them to git, then we learned how to change the name of a file with git and then we went in to the file and edited the link to that page and added the _cal to the end.</p>

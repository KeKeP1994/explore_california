<h1>Chapter 8 Notes</h1>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p> In this chapter we learned how to use the command gititgnore and all we had to do was create a folder called .gitignore and this file was a set of rules so git knew what files to ignore. Then we learned what files should be ignored so we would know what kind would be right to ignored. Then we learned that outside the git repository and we have user configure files, and then we learned that if you list them in the global file then everyone who goes to the file it will prompt them to ignore certain files that we have added to it. Then we learned how to tell git how to ignore already tracked files and you do this by  going to the gitignore the file then add the name and save the changes and then the tracked file will be ignored after you commit it. Another way to stop tracking a file you can just remove the file and or we can tell it to stop tracking by doing the rm --cached then the file name this will tell the file to removed from the staging index not the repository it will just not be tracked but still in the repository.   Then we learned how to track a empty directory ad we do it like this put a file in the file so it will track it and if you want to track an empty directory you can use a fake file and call it .gitignore or .gitkeep and you don't even need to add any content to it if you don't want to, when you look to the directory from the desktop it will look empty because what you added was a . file.</p>
